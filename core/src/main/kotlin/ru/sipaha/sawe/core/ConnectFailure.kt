/**
 * Classified reason a [RemoteClient] connection attempt failed.
 *
 * Each variant carries a [userMessage] suitable for direct display in the
 * UI — short, actionable, and free of stack-trace noise — plus an optional
 * [cause] for debug logging. The split exists so the UI never has to
 * pattern-match on free-form error strings; the call site is what decides
 * how to phrase a failure, not the consumer.
 *
 * Categorisation:
 * - [Unreachable] — TCP/TLS couldn't connect (no route, refused, timeout,
 *   DNS lookup failed). Retryable. Most likely cause: server's IP/port not
 *   reachable from the phone (NAT not port-forwarded, wrong public IP in
 *   the QR, server not running, firewall).
 * - [TlsPinMismatch] — TLS handshake completed at the protocol level but
 *   the peer's leaf certificate didn't match the SHA-256 pin from the QR.
 *   Terminal. Either the server regenerated its cert (rare; persisted by
 *   default per R-2) or a man-in-the-middle is in the path.
 * - [AuthRejected] — server explicitly rejected the HMAC challenge.
 *   Terminal. The secret in the QR is wrong, the client was removed from
 *   the server's authorised list, or the secret was rotated.
 * - [HandshakeTimeout] — TCP+TLS+WS upgrade succeeded but the server
 *   didn't send the 16-byte challenge nonce within [HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS]
 *   (10s by default). Retryable; usually means a peer that isn't actually
 *   spk-editor on the other end, or a server bug.
 * - [ProtocolError] — the server sent something this client doesn't
 *   understand (wrong-length nonce, malformed verdict, unexpected text
 *   frame before nonce). Retryable per attempt but recurring = server
 *   protocol drift.
 * - [TlsNegotiationFailed] — the TLS handshake itself failed for a reason
 *   that wasn't a pin mismatch (cipher/protocol mismatch, peer aborted
 *   the handshake mid-flight, …). Retryable per attempt, but the same
 *   error recurring usually means a misconfigured server.
 * - [ServerClosed] — server closed the WebSocket during the handshake
 *   (often code 1008 "policy violation" = unauthorised client). Often
 *   means the same as [AuthRejected] but framed differently.
 * - [Unknown] — fallback for anything the classifier didn't recognise.
 *   The raw message is preserved in [userMessage] so the user at least
 *   has something to copy when reporting a bug.
