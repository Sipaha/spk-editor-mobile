 * Pure decision logic for the chat connection-status banner (Feature B).

 * The banner is shown ONLY when the connection is NOT [ConnectionState.Connected]
 * — a healthy session shows nothing. Given the current [ConnectionState] this
 * returns the static (state-dependent) label, or `null` when the banner must be
 * hidden. The Android composable appends the localized "последний обмен …"
 * relative-time suffix separately (it needs [android.text.format.DateUtils]),
 * so this stays platform-free and unit-testable.
 *
 * Strings are Russian to match the app's Russian UI.
