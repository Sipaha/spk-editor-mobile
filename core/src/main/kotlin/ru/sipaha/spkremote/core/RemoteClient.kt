/**
 * Resilient connection to one SPK Editor instance.
 *
 * **Handshake (each attempt):**
 *   1. WebSocket upgrade to `wss://host:port/remote` (TLS pinned by
 *      [PairingUrl.fingerprint]).
 *   2. Receive 16-byte binary nonce.
 *   3. Send 32-byte binary HMAC-SHA256 response (see [HmacChallengeAuth]).
 *   4. Receive ASCII verdict `OK` (accept) or `REJECT` (terminate).
 *   5. Carry JSON-RPC text frames in both directions. Frames with an `id`
 *      that matches an outstanding [call] resolve that call. Frames without
 *      an `id` (or with an unknown id) are emitted on [notifications].
 *
 * **Resilience (R-6a):**
 *   - A long-running lifecycle coroutine owns the WS. When a transport-level
 *     drop happens (network change, NAT timeout, server restart), the
 *     coroutine transitions [connectionState] to [ConnectionState.Reconnecting]
 *     and retries with [BackoffStrategy.Default].
 *   - Terminal failures (TLS pin mismatch, HMAC reject, version skew) drop
 *     to [ConnectionState.FailedTerminal] without auto-retry — the user
 *     must re-pair.
 *   - [subscribe]/[unsubscribe] track the active event-kind set; on every
 *     successful reconnect handshake the set is replayed so subscribers see
 *     no notification gap longer than the reconnect window itself.
 *   - [queueCall] is the production-grade send entry point — if the wire is
 *     down, the request is held in an in-memory FIFO until the next
 *     [ConnectionState.Connected] transition or until its TTL expires.
 *
 * **Concurrency model:** every state mutation that's visible across awaits
 * (pending requests, subscription set, queued items) goes through suspending
 * methods running on the supplied [scope]; OkHttp's I/O threads only drive
 * the [RemoteTransportListener] callbacks, which post events onto the
 * lifecycle channel and return immediately.
