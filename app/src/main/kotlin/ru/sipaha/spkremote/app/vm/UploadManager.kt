/**
 * Per-attachment chunked-upload state machine for the mobile attach
 * flow.
 *
 * Each `start()` call returns a `(localKey, StateFlow<State>)` pair —
 * the compose row stashes both on the [ru.sipaha.spkremote.app.ui.solutions.PickedAttachment]
 * record so its preview card can render percent / done / failed states
 * by collecting the StateFlow, and the cancel × button can call
 * `cancel(localKey)`.
 *
 * ### State machine
 *
 *   Queued ──► Uploading ──► Done       (happy path)
 *      │           │
 *      │           └──► Paused ──► Uploading (reconnect resume)
 *      ▼
 *   Failed                                  (terminal, user can retry by
 *                                            re-attaching)
 *
 *  * `Queued` — `start()` was called but the chunk loop hasn't begun
 *    (no active connection yet, or `upload_init` is in flight).
 *  * `Uploading(sent, total)` — chunk loop is making progress.
 *  * `Paused` — connection dropped mid-stream OR an ack timed out; the
 *    coroutine is dead, ready for `resumeAll()` to start a fresh loop
 *    against the server's authoritative offset.
 *  * `Done` — `upload_finish` returned a `spk-upload://<id>` handle the
 *    compose row attaches to its outbound `send_message_blocks` payload.
 *  * `Failed` — terminal; `start()` won't recover automatically (e.g.
 *    upload_init refused, server reported `unknown_upload_id` on
 *    resume because the slot was GC'd).
 *
 * ### Notification plumbing
 *
 * Acks (`upload_chunk_acked`) are forwarded to UploadManager by the
 * single shared notification collector in
 * [SessionListStore.ensureNotificationsObserver] via the
 * [SessionListStore.uploadNotificationRouter] callback hook. Each
 * forwarded payload is routed to the per-upload [ackChannels] map; the
 * matching coroutine awaits the next ack and advances its offset.
 *
 * ### Persistence
 *
 * Every successful ack is written to [persistence] before the
 * StateFlow advances. The on-disk record is the only thing that
 * survives a process kill — on next launch, [resumeAllFromDisk] is
 * called by the coordinator and revives one coroutine per persisted
 * upload, each of which calls `upload_status` against the server to
 * get the authoritative offset before restarting the chunk loop.
