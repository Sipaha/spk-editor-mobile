/**
 * Persists the active navigation route so cold start can land the user
 * back where they were (R-6d).
 *
 * **R-6c-multi per-server scoping:** the route key embeds the active
 * server id (`route:<serverId>`), so switching from server A → server B
 * doesn't carry over A's deep-link target. The cold-start replay reads
 * the route for whichever server is being auto-resumed.
 *
 * **Why disk:** R-6b's auto-resume lands the user on `solutions` after
 * a successful pairing replay, which is correct when they last had the
 * solutions list open — but jarring when they were mid-chat on a deep
 * route like `solutions/{id}/sessions/{sid}`. Persisting the most-recent
 * resolved route closes that loop.
 *
 * **Route format:** the saved route string is the *resolved* navigation
 * route with arguments substituted (e.g. `solutions/abc/sessions/xyz`),
 * not the template (`solutions/{solutionId}/sessions/{sessionId}`). The
 * caller in `AppNavGraph` builds the resolved form from the
 * `NavBackStackEntry`'s arguments before saving — see [saveRoute] kdoc.
 *
 * **Validation on resume:** the cold-start path in `MainActivity` reads
 * the saved route via [loadRoute], hands it to the nav controller, and
 * — if the resulting destination 404s on lookup (e.g. the user deleted
 * the session from the desktop in the meantime) — falls back to
 * `solutions` and clears the saved route. We do NOT pre-validate
 * (session_exists round-trip before navigating) because the validation
 * happens naturally inside the screen anyway: SessionDetailScreen calls
 * `openSession` which exercises `get_session`, and a 404 there shows
 * the error state and the user pops back to a working route.
 *
 * **Storage:** plain [SharedPreferences]. The route string is purely
 * cosmetic (no auth secret), and encrypting it would slow cold-start
 * unnecessarily.
