/**
 * Currently-open session detail — transcript, optimistic bubbles, draft

 * the previous god-object `SessionStore`.
 *
 * ### Invariants
 *
 *  1. **`openSessionId` is `@Volatile` + every `_session` write is
 *     guarded by a stale-write barrier** — any coroutine that resolves a
 *     network result MUST re-check `openSessionId == sessionId` immediately
 *     before writing `_session.value`, otherwise a late delivery for a
 *     just-closed session can resurrect the previous transcript on top
 *     of the new session's `Loading`.
 *  2. **`detailSubscribed` is owned by [SessionListStore]** — the single
 *     notification collector lives there; this store consumes routed
 *     events via the [DetailNotificationRouter] hook implemented below.
 *  3. **Read-modify-write mutations on `_session.value` are serialised
 *     under [sessionMutex]** — multiple coroutines (notification observer,
 *     fetchAndReplaceEntry, loadOlder, resumeSession) compete for the
 *     same flow; without the mutex a stale snapshot can be re-published
 *     on top of a newer one.
 *  4. **Optimistic bubbles carry two ids** — a local stable id
 *     ([optimisticIdGen]) used by the cancel-by-id failure path and a
 *     wire-side `client_send_id` stamp ([optimisticClientSendIds])
 *     stamped onto the originating ContentBlock's
 *     `_meta.spk_client_send_id`. The pure `reconcileOptimistic`
 *     prefers id-based matching; falls back to content-match for legacy
 *     server entries (pre-rollout) or cross-client echoes that don't
 *     carry a csid.
 *  5. **The shared [lastSeen] index is the single source of truth** —
 *     don't store a sibling map; both this store and [SessionListStore]
 *     read/write through [LastSeenIndex].
